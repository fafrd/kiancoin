# kiancoin

Kiancoin is an ethereum token. There's one kiancoin in existence, and currently I own it.

Reach out to me if you would like to own part of the kiancoin. I can't guarantee it will help you financially, but perhaps it means something deeper, as if you're owning part of my self.

Contract is currently deployed here: [0xb259adadb959ebb03cb280fba58cc3172e96dc78](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb259adadb959ebb03cb280fba58cc3172e96dc78#code)

## Building

I've been using the openzeppelin command to compile and deploy.

Compile the code:

    npx oz compile

Deploy (first with a local [ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) testnet, then to mainnet):

    npx oz deploy
